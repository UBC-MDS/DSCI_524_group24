RidgeMake is a lightweight regression and visualization package for fitting a line to paired data, plotting points, overlaying the fitted line, and reporting an R² score.

## Quick start

```{python}
#| eval: false
from ridge_remake import get_reg_line, ridge_scatter, ridge_scatter_line, ridge_get_r2

x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [2, 4, 5, 4, 5]

line = get_reg_line(x, y)
fig = ridge_scatter(x, y)
fig = ridge_scatter_line(fig, line)

r2 = ridge_get_r2(x, y)
print("R2:", r2)
