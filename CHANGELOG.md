## [0.1.0] - milestone1

For this milestone, our team established the foundational structure and collaboration practices for the RidgeMake package.

We drafted a team work contract to define expectations, accountability, and communication norms within the team. The contract is kept private as required by the course guidelines.

We collaboratively selected the project topic and created the public project repository under the UBC-MDS GitHub organization using the minimal Python package template with the MIT license.

We added a project overview and planned functionality to this README, including a high-level description of the package, a list of proposed functions, and a description of how the package fits within the broader Python ecosystem.

We also added and customized a Code of Conduct and defined our collaboration workflow and contribution strategy in the CONTRIBUTING.md file.

## [0.3.0] - milestone3

- We configured a GitHub Actions continuous integration (CI) workflow to automatically run the test suite and style checks on every push and pull request to the main branch.

- We also configured a continuous deployment (CD) workflow that runs the same checks and publishes the package to TestPyPI on every push to the main branch. A successful deployment is indicated by the release badge on the repository README.

- Finally, we added more unit tests to improve test coverage and to validate the continuous integration and deployment workflows through pull requests.
